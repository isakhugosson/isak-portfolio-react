    text: `A quick learner who finds ways to improve the team's work - this is what comes to my mind when I think about Isak. I had the pleasure of working with Isak for almost a year, during which I was his direct manager.\n\nI was particularly impressed by how quickly Isak learnt all new work tools, processes and complex concepts when he joined the team, and how he continuously suggested ways to improve the team's work, for example by introducing automation tools such as Power Automate.\n\nAnother trait that makes Isak stand out is that he is calm and pedagogical, something he has been praised for several times by different colleagues. Isak earns my highest recommendations, and I'm confident that he will be an asset to any team or employer!`,

    text: `I had the pleasure of being Isak's Line Manager whilst he worked in my team. Isak was great to have in the team, he was curious, smart, delivered results on time and regularly delivered more than expected.\n\nIsak was working in an international environment and built great relationships with colleagues across multiple countries with strong feedback received from them.\n\nI particularly appreciated Isaks approach which was to get involved in as many topics as he could to learn and develop whilst inspiring others to do the same.`,
